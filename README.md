# PGL Example Project

This repository contains an example project that demonstrates how to use the Plebian Graph Library (PGL). PGL is a powerful library for visualizing large-scale network data in web browsers, leveraging the capabilities of WebGL.

## Overview

This example project is set up to show a basic implementation of PGL, providing a starting point for those looking to integrate PGL into their own projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/range-et/pgl_example
cd pgl_example
```
